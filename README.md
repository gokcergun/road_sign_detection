# Road Sign Detection Computer Vision Project
Date: January, 2022
Dataset: Road-Signs from MakeML: https://makeml.app/datasets/road-signs
  download path: https://arcraftimages.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/Datasets/RoadSigns/RoadSignsPascalVOC.zip?region=us-east-2

Project Steps: 
1. The dataset preprocessing is done on local computer using DataPrepration.ipynb juypter lab notebook.
2. Dataset is manually uploaded on personal Google Drive.
3. Yolov5 training and evaluation steps is run on Google Colabs using Road_Sign_Yolov5 colabs notebook. https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 implementation is used (pytorch). 
4. R-Mask CNN training and evaluation steps is run on Google Colabs using .... colabs notebook. https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN.git implementation is used (tensorflow).
